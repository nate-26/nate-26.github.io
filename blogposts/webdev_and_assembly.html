        <h2>On the Creation of this Website and Assembler</h2>
        <h3>June 15, 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I don't have much interesting to say other than the creation of this website has been a
            very big learning experience for me. It's exciting to even think that I have my own
            website in the first place. In making this website I finally learned some JavaScript
            and refined my HTML and CSS skills a bit more. I will continue to learn more web development 
            as time goes on and create interesting blog posts in the future. I might make some posts 
            going into detail about my past programming experience. For now, I am just happy to 
            be here typing this.

        <h4>On Assembly</h4>
        <p>
            As a side note, I am soon going to begin my class on Assembly which is very exciting.
            The first time I ever heard of assembly was from a YouTube video made by
            John Hammond. In the video he makes a "simple" Hello World program in assembly.
            It was a very interesting video, and at the time I was amazed (and a little intimidated)
            by how complex the language seemed to be. Nonetheless, I am eager to take on this challenge,
            as everyone seems to consider assembly as this mythical wizardry language. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not saying this class is going to be super easy, but in my experience
            cs students love to exaggerate. So I will be approaching this with an open mind,
            rather than anxiety and fear.
