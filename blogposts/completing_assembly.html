        <h2>Completing Assembly</h2>
        <h3>August 13, 2024</h3>
        <p>
            Now that I've officially finished assembly I feel that I can say that it is a very difficult language,
            but it is also very interesting and rewarding. My school has a strange approach to teaching the material,
            as I technically learned a niche version of the language. We programmed every assignment on a z/OS mainframe,
            rather than learning x86 assembly we learned using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASSIST_(computing)">ASSIST</a>,
            which is an interpreter that is compatible with the IBM System/370 environment. Personally, I would've preferred learning
            the former. I think that the it would've been more fun to learn x86, especially since the TN3270 terminal was a pain to
            work with lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, I believed that I learned valuable information about working with memory so closely.
            I believe that every programmer should learn a bit of assembly, especially if you might be interested in reverse engineering. 
            Overall, I think that the class was a good use of time. I believe that in the future I will want to try to make some projects in assembly
            just for the fun of it. I cannot express how much I missed using modern text editors though, I don't think I ever want
            to use a TN3270 terminal again. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have 13 days until I start the fall semester, and I am excited to continue my journey. I am taking a class on software development,
            which is exactly how it sounds. I can't wait to work with a modern tech stack.
